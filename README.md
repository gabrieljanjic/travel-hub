## Authentication & Authorization
### Overview
The app uses JWT-based authentication with secure HTTP-only cookies.
Users can register, log in, and stay authenticated between sessions.
Protected API routes require a valid token for access.

## Auth Flow
1. User registers or logs in
2. Server hashes password using bcrypt
3. Server signs a JWT token with userId and sets it in a secure cookie
4. Cookie is automatically sent with withCredentials: true in all API calls
5. Middleware validates the token before granting access
